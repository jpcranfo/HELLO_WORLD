# HELLO_WORLD
First repository I created on Github

This is a typical Hello World program, used to familiarize myself with Github.

About me:
I earned my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Duke University in 2014, focusing on computational modeling of the electrical properties of muscle tissue.  I now aim to use my computational modeling experience to work on something truly revolutionary and beneficial to humankind.   I am casting a wide net, using my Ph.D. research as a working skill set for exploring a range of opportunities that use computational techniques to improve the human condition, ranging from neuroscience and mindfulness meditation, to data science and the climate, to wearable wellness technology.   I am looking forward to the next thing!
